<h2>Description</h2>
<p>It is a classic Italian side dish with short-grain rice cooked in stock until it’s creamy. Adding parmesan makes it cheesy, decadent, and irresistible. Homemade Risotto is probably the most impressive method for cooking rice. </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Onion – we use yellow onion and finely chop it up so it blends nicely into the rice</li>
    <li>Garlic – adds great flavor. </li>
    <li>Chicken stock</li>
    <li>Short-grain rice</li>
    <li>White wine</li>
    <li> Parmesan Cheese </li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Heat the stock – In a separate large saucepan, heat your chicken stock to a simmer then reduce to the lowest heat just to keep it very hot without boiling.</li>
    <li>Cook aromatics – in a heavy pot or dutch oven over medium-low heat, add butter and oil, and sautee onions with salt, stirring with a spatula until softened (do not brown the onions). Add garlic and stir for 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Toast rice – add rice, increase to medium heat, and stir for about 3 minutes until the rice is toasted and starting to look translucent.</li>
    <li>Add white wine – stir in the white wine and continue stirring for 2 minutes or until mostly evaporated.</li>
    <li>Add stock – using a ladle, add one ladle-full at a time and continue stirring until absorbed before adding another ladle-full. Continue this process until the rice reaches your desired doneness. This takes 20-25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add-ins – add the remaining butter and parmesan cheese then season to taste with salt if needed and serve garnished with more cheese and freshly cracked black pepper.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
